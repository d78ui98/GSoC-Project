Here is what I did last week?
- Implemented `auto_config` feature in `Vagrantfile`[1]
- Made several changes in provisioner script to adapt to the newer version of ltsp[1]
- Fixed DNS issue in ltsp setup[2]
- Added guest-login and auto-login functionality in ltsp server for ltsp client[3]
- Improving the Debian Edu packages for uploading them to mentors.debian.net

Problems I could not solve
- Still, need to make some improvements in Debian Edu packages before uploading them

Plans for next week
- Upload the packages to mentor.debian.net[4]
- Create scripts to automatically build vagrant boxes[5]
- Create a script to manage bulk user accounts[6]
- Then I will start with testing again, improve documentation to make final upload of code to google
