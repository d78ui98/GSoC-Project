Hello everyone,

Here is what I did last week?
- Converted regular dhcp server to proxy dhcp server to automatically reconfigure dnsmasq on boot[1]
- Simplified client.sh. Almost 50% reduction in lines of code for bionic and buster branch[2]
- Completed remaining work on client login problem[3]
- Collected resource and joined mailing lists to study debian packaging[4]    
- Worked on using virtual LTSP server with hostonly adapter. PR is approved but were looking for a better solution[5]
- With some help from mentors found a better solution by using test.sh script that creates and deletes virtual adapter that can be used for LAN bridging[6]

Problems I could not solve
- Did not get time to read all resources on debian packaging.

Plans for next week
- Improve already written code.
- Complete wiki page on how to troubleshoot from ltsp client[7]
- Study debian packaging and port ubuntu-edu packages to debian[8][9]
- Plan out what needs to be done to support raspberry pi clients by ltsp server and ltsp manager[10]
