Here is what I did last week
Made enhancements on buster branch[1]
   added auto-config feature
   enabled autologin and guestlogin
   More functionality to test.sh
Enhancements in `accounts.sh` script to manage user accounts in bulk.[2]
Created a bug report as a request to merge the edu packages that I created[3]
Provided dhcp range to dhcp server for testing[4][5]
Updated documentation[6]
Removed vagrant-cachier plugin, enabled dns[7]
We are also trying to involve the other students that wanted to work on this project[8]

Plans for next week and after
