Hello Everyone,

Here is what I did last week
Most of the time week was devoted for testing the entire project in various distribution, cases, and environment. 
Also tried using Virtual ltsp server with 10 virtual clients on real LAN.
Next task to do was fix the issues found. One such issue was fixing IP address issue caused by switching to linux mint.[1]
Another issue was the internet was not working on ltsp client. Fixed that one[2]

Problems I could not solve
Didn't get time to work on autologin and to write packer script to create vagrant box. As a lot of time was given to testing. 
Still trying to work on auto_config of the network part of Vagrantfile
Plans for next week
Implement networking in Vagrantfile with auto_config[3]
More testing[4]
Work on autologin feature[5]
Write packer script to create vagrant box[6]
