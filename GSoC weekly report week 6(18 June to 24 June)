What I did last week?
- added `test.sh` script on buster branch that creates virtual interface[1]
- made several improvements in `test.sh` script to create a virtual network in both buster and bionic branch[2][3][4]
- Informed the maintainers about a minor bug in official ubuntu ltsp-pnp page. It is now fixed.
- wrote wiki page on how to troubleshoot ltsp setup[5]
- wrote a blog on how vagrantc(creator of ltsp) helped me fix the client login problem.[6]
- studied about building Debian package from resources collected last week
- wrote a script to automatically port and install ubuntu-edu packages to Debian(open PR and needs some improvements)[7]
- Searched and tested the difference between ltsp-server and ltsp-server-standalone package[8]

Problems I could not solve
- deb folder currently has unnecessary files. Need to remove those.
- did not get time to study how to support raspberry pi clients by ltsp server
- finish up the work between differentiating both ltsp setups[8]
- need to split testing wiki page into automated and manual testing pages
- 

Plans for next week
- finish up the remaining work in mentioned in problem not solved
- work on issues #58 #59 #60 #61 #62 #63 #64[9][10][11][12][13][14][15]
- research on what needs to be done in ltsp-server to support RaspberryPi clients[16]
- added more features to ltsp-manager[17]
