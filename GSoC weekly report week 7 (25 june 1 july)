Hello everyone,

Here is what I did last week?
- Created fully functional `test.sh` script for testing. It will create virtual interface, startup ltsp-server, and dhcp server and then the client with a single command and destroy them with another command.[1]
- Differentiated between ltsp-server and ltsp-server-standalone package by looking at package source[2]
- Added GUI to vagrant box[3]
- Several Improvements in `settings.sh` configuration file.[4]
- Created a second troubleshooting page and testing plan. Mentor wrote a better testing plan for me [5]
- Enabled debugging on all shell scripts[6]
- Added `edu.sh` that creates Debian packages from a custom source of  and installs them to ltsp server vagrant box[7]

Problems I could not solve
- Working on Improving docs[8]
- Tested internally and externally only. Have to test on real LAN[9]

Plans for next week
- Next week I am planning on testing according to testing plan and Fixing all the bugs that I find.[10]
- Will be improving the docs[11]
- Create custom vagrant box[12]
- Explore and implement vagrant caching[13]
