Hello everyone,

Here is what I did last week
- made ltsp server flexible by added setting.sh configuration file
- updated Vagrantfile to load IP address, network address from settings.sh
- updated Vagrantfile to automatically detect network adapter connected to the internet [1]
- updated provision script to get data from settings.sh [1]
- wrote a wiki pages explaining modes of operation of LTSP and steps for manual testing [2]
- created a lightweight dhcp server with vagrant for testing [3]
- Installed ltsp in Debian stretch and buster release with Vagrant [4]

The problems that I could not solve
- For some reason, ltsp client is unable to boot from the server. Will try to fix that in this week
- Work on a simpler way to build ltsp client for automated testing

Plans for next week
- fix ltsp client booting problem
- work on building ltsp client for automated testing
-Study Debian packaging
- build a Debian package for ltsp-manager
