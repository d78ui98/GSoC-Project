This was interesting week was working on the project all the time in weekdays.

Here is what I did last week?
- Implemented vagarant cachier plugin to speed up testing, installation and configuration of ltsp setup[1]
- Learned how to build vagrant box from scratch blog post and wiki page for the same[2][3]
- Created a vagrant box and uploaded on vagrant cloud. Also released a second more compack version[4]
- Fixed ltsp client login issue[5]
- Added variable to settings.sh configuration file to add vagrant box instead of hardcoding it[6] 
- Updated docs[7]
- Added linux mint 19 xfce ltsp box[8]
- Added testing steps, commands, etc in readme file[9]

Problems I could not solve
- Have to create packer scripts to automatically create vagrant boxes from iso[10]

Plans for next week
- Look into internal of docker script then work building a LTSP server container[11]
- finsh pending tasks
- implement autologin for ltsp clients[12]
