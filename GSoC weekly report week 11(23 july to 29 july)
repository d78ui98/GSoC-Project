Hello everyone,

Here is what I did last week?
For most of the time in the week I was working on building packer template linux mint 19[1]
updated readme file[1]
Added education packages to debian edu. Improved primaryschool package[2]
Released vagrant box version 1.0.2[3]
Made some changes in virtual ltsp project to adapt to version 1.0.2[3]
Studied how to use reportbug and filed bug (severity: wishlist) using it.
All the improvments that were made in bionic branch are now made in buster branch as well[4]
Added script to manager user accounts in bulk[5]

Problems I could not solve
I had to wait for bug to get reported to merge the packages[6]

Plans for next week
Improve documentation
Work on buster branch[7]
Test everything to make sure everything works as expected[8]
